HasClassAttr
============

has_class_attr is a small helper plugin.  It really is not tied to rails, but I 
think it is too small for a gem :)

Its purpose is to set a instance variable on a class definition and expose it
through a method.


Example
=======

Old Way:

def MyClass
  @items = [1,2,3]

  def self.static_items
    @items
  end
end

MyClass.static_items #[1,2,3]


New Way:
def MyClass
  has_class_attr :items, :data => [1,2,3]
end

MyClass.items #[1,2,3]
